# 👋 Hi, I'm @emmanuel-io

## 🍋 What I Do

I build thoughtful, performance-oriented software — from backend systems and embedded tools to automation scripts and internal platforms.

**In the software industry for 25+ years**, I’ve worked across embedded, cloud, and SaaS domains — always with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and delivering lasting value.

I work well independently or with teams, adapting fast and always aiming for meaningful outcomes over shiny tech.

## 👀 What I’m Into

- async/await patterns, concurrency, and multiprocessing — the right tool for the right flow  
- squeezing performance out of limited resources without overengineering  
- internal tools that reduce friction and support teams  
- codebases that age well and are a pleasure to read

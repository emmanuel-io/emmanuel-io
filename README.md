# 👋 Hi, I'm emmanuel IO

**Digital Solutions Developer**  
🌍 Working 100% remotely

## 🍋 What I do

I build thoughtful, performance-oriented software — from backend systems and embedded tools to automation scripts and internal platforms.

**In the software industry for 25+ years**, I’ve worked across embedded, cloud, and SaaS domains — always with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and delivering lasting value.

I work well independently or with teams, adapting fast and always aiming for meaningful outcomes over shiny tech.

## 👀 What I’m into

- async/await patterns, concurrency, and multiprocessing — the right tool for the right flow  
- squeezing performance out of limited resources without overengineering  
- internal tools that reduce friction and support teams  
- codebases that age well and are a pleasure to read  

## 🧰 Tech that drives me

**Languages**: Python, C, JavaScript, Go  
**Frameworks**: FastAPI, Django REST Framework, Vue.js  
**Tools**: Docker, SQLAlchemy, Celery, RabbitMQ, pytest  
**Domains**: Backend, APIs, Embedded Systems, Dev Tools
